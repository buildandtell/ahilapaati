### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello, my name is Abhishek Choudhury and I‚Äôm an artist and designer. My work mostly revolves around illustrations, storybooks, comics, and movies. I‚Äôm mostly known for my illustrations but I‚Äôve dabbled in concept art and animation as well.

### What hardware do you use?

I‚Äôve always used a [Wacom Intuos 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom#Intuos) drawing tablet for the longest time (2012 onwards) and I could not have asked for a more trustworthy companion for my journey into digital art. I‚Äôve recently migrated to the iPad for most of my digital art and illustrations. I‚Äôm slowly getting a hang of it and enjoying the feeling of drawing on a handy portable surface. I‚Äôm using an [iPad pro (1st gen)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro#First_generation) 10.5 inch 256 GB.

### And what software?

When I‚Äôm working on my PC I use the [Adobe creative suite](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html), mainly Adobe Photoshop for illustration (raster) and Adobe illustrator for all kinds of graphic design work (vector). Occasionally, I use AfterEffects for animation or motion-graphic work and [InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign) for publication related work.

### How do you go about your work?

There‚Äôs no fixed mantra as such. I make it a point to get plenty of rest and try not to overexert myself. It‚Äôs really initial‚Äôs to take breaks during creative quirky to avoid burning out or over-saturating yourself. I am a night owl so I work best when the world sleeps. I Make it a point to keep myself updated and stay connected with what‚Äôs the latest in the world of art and design and to keep updating my visual vocabulary. It‚Äôs very important to stay up to date and keep experimenting and sparring with the changing times and trends.

### What would be your dream setup?

I would love to own one of the [Microsoft surface studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Studio). They look so intuitive and efficient for design work. I would love to have a VR setup like a [Vive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive) or [Oculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_VR) to create virtual worlds. I‚Äôve always wanted a small studio Corner for audio-video recording sessions. A well-stocked library with my favorite art books, graphic novels, Zines and A spot to house my action figures. üèÉ
