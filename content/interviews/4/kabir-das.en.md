### Who are you, and what do you do

I'm Kabir Das (22 year old). I identify myself as an entrepreneur & developer focusing on computer vision & incubatee of [Assam Startup - The Nest](http://startup.assam.gov.in/). I'm currently working as the CTO for One Stop Kitchen Food & Technology Pvt. Ltd while working for my startup, Cipher Studios developing a product for the Retail Industry and partly work as the Technical Consultant in a Marketing Agency, [Blindspot Media](mediablidspot.in).

### What hardware do you use

Personally, most of my work gets done on a [Macbook Pro 13" 2015](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-retina-15-inch-2015) . Albeit a bit old, but gets my work done perfectly.
 
### And what software

In a gist, I have 2 different categories of work on a day-to-day basis.

**Development** : Gets taken care of with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) primarily.

**Management** :  [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/in/numbers/).

I'm not considering the different niche tools and platforms I use like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)ред for journals and code visualizations
 
### How do you go about your work

If this means my work through the day:

1) I usually have a predefined set of tasks for any specific day set earlier but TBH it gets thrown out the window 80% of the time.
2) I tend to devote the initial hours of the day for emails and correspondece.
3) I follow that up with all the client standups and calls through the afternoon
4) Most of the early to later evenings are taken up by meetings(operational & non-operational) almsost every day
5) I try to get most of my development work done late night
 
If this means my usual work approach:

1) A detailed rundown is done regarding the project, figuring out the profitability and all the dependencies
2) It's always structured into phases and modules with people delegated to handle each of them
3) I focus on iterating with the client or the main objective in weekly standups to make sure the project is on time and meets the requirements
 
### What would be your dream setup

I dont really have absolutely specfic needs coz I believe my setup is my team. We collectively form the Hub & Spoke of this machine. But If it means a personal work setup, I would have a [Dell UltraSharp 4K Monitor](https://www.dell.com/si/business/p/dell-u2718q-monitor/pd ) with a specced out [Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/in/macbook-pro-16/) alongwith the [Bose QC35 II Headphones](https://www.boseindia.com/en_in/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black).
