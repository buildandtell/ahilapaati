### Who are you, and what do you do?
	- I'm Kabir Das (22 year old). 
	- I identify myself as an entrepreneur & developer focusing on computer vision & incubatee of [Assam Startup - The Nest](http://startup.assam.gov.in/)
	- I'm working full time for my startup, Cipher Studios developing a product for the Retail Industry and partly work as the Technical Consultant in a Marketing Agency, [Blindspot Media](mediablidspot.in).


### What hardware do you use?
	- Personally, most of my work gets done on a Macbook Pro 13" 2015. Albeit a bit old, but gets my work done perfectly.
	
### And what software?
	- In a gist, I have 2 different categories of work on a day-to-day basis.
		- Development : Gets taken care of with Visual Studio Code primarily
		- Management : Trello, Slack, Airtable, Numbers
	- I'm not considering the different niche tools and platforms I use like Jupyter for journals and code visualizations
	
### How do you go about your work?

	> If this means my work through the day	 
	- I usually have a predefined set of tasks for any specific day set earlier but TBH it gets thrown out the window 80% of the time.
	- I tend to devote the initial hours of the day for emails and correspondece.
	- I follow that up with all the client standups and calls through the afternoon
	- Most of the early to later evenings are taken up by meetings(operational & non-operational) almsost every day
	- I try to get most of my development work done late night
	
	> If this means my usual work approach
	
	- A detailed rundown is done regarding the project, figuring out the profitability and all the dependencies
	- Its always structured into phases and modules with people delegated to handle each of them
	- I focus on iterating with the client or the main objective in weekly standups to make sure the project is on time and meets the requirements
	
### What would be your dream setup?
	- I dont really have absolutely specfic needs coz I believe my setup is my team. We collectively form the Hub & Spoke of this machine.
	- But If it means a personal work setup, I would have a Dell UltraSharp 4k monitor with a speced out Macbook Pro alongwith the Bose QC35 ii pair of headphones.
