### Who are you, and what do you do

Hi, I am [Debashree](https://www.instagram.com/debashreedas_photography/) and I am a Photographer. It was only in 2017 that I took up freelance photography as a profession, before which I was working as an engineer in Vodafone. Besides photography I've also done some work in social media management and have also started a minimalist clothing line called Cocoon Street. But mostly, I identify as a photographer. In photography, most of the work I do is in fashion and lifestyle.

### What hardware do you use

My camera bag consists of my [Nikon D750](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/digital-slr-cameras/d750) and the lenses are [50mm f1.8](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/nikkor-lenses/f-mount/fx-format/single-focal-length/af-s-nikkor-50mm-f-1-8g), [35mm f1.8](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/nikkor-lenses/f-mount/dx-format/single-focal-length/af-s-dx-nikkor-35mm-f-1-8g), [24-120mm f4](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/nikkor-lenses/f-mount/fx-format/zoom/af-s-nikkor-24-120mm-f-4g-ed-vr), [85mm f1.8](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/nikkor-lenses/f-mount/fx-format/single-focal-length/af-s-nikkor-85mm-f-1-8g), [10-20mm f3.5](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/633618-REG/Sigma_202306_10_20mm_f_3_5.html?SID=kc8vpao8k302l1pj02fa9).
I prefer shooting with natural light, but have been experimenting with a Digitek strobe light [DSF 610](http://www.imsmercantiles.in/product/wireless-studio-flash-dsf-610-pro-plus-2/) with modifiers like an octabox, beauty dish, or without modifiers. The kit is very basic and I would love to invest in more high end lenses and modifiers when the time comes. As of now am trying to use what I have in the best way possible.

### And what software

For all photography post processing work like retouching, album design, etc I use Adode [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html) and [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop-lightroom.html). On my mobile I use apps like [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en_IN), [VSCO](https://vsco.co/).

### How do you go about your work

Most of the shoots are brand collection/catalogue/lookbook shoots so for these there is a process of planning the look of the shoot with the client. All aspects of the shoot like set, mood, models, styling, makeup, lighting, etc are planned before the shoot. Creative inputs are included from both sides (the client and me) and while shooting I try my best to emulate the expectations from this discussion. There is always a lot of research involved before any shoot.
When doing personal projects, there are no set rules or guidelines. It's more about going with the flow and seeing where your creative mind takes you. But I always do try to enjoy whatever it is I am doing.

### What would be your dream setup

My dream setup would be a huge well lit studio. I am fortunate enough to have built myself a small home studio now, which does not exactly get a lot of natural light. But I would love to have a bigger studio with tall windows to let all the light come in. Would also love to have some gorgeous [Oliphant backdrops](https://www.oliphantstudio.com/), a [24-70mm](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/nikkor-lenses/f-mount/fx-format/zoom/af-s-nikkor-24-70mm-f-2-8e-ed-vr) lens, [Profoto](https://profoto.com/in) lights, large modifiers, and the list goes on.
