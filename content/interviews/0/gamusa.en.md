### Who are you, and what do you do?
Hello and Hi, I am Gamusa(গামোচা) and I am pretty cool actually, if you ask. I hang out with this [man with a 56-inch chest](/interviews/0/modi.jpg), [Norvig](/interviews/0/pete.jpg), [Mehmet Dogar](/interviews/0/mehmet.jpg) and so many other interesting people that I have lost count. Heck! someone even made [COVID-19](/interviews/0/mask.jpg) masks out of me, so you can say I am pretty darn useful.

I have been to places but the truth is, I have the most fun hanging around the people of Assam which is what I've been doing since the day I was born. [I have Zubeen's *Maya*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgkFvPHqOWU) added multiple times to my sleep music playlist, just thought that was interesting information.

Oh! I didn't tell you who I was? Well, technically I am a piece of rectangular cloth, red and white are my favorite color scheme for obvious reasons. I did my graduation from Cotton University by majoring in textiles and that's where I figured out that I could significantly increase my personal brand valuation by just switching to silk threads.

I basically just hang around different places. Yeah, that's what I do.

### What hardware do you use?
The more important question here in my opinion is “What are you used for?”, let me tell you. There's a paradox; on one hand, I am used for things of great respect and on the other hand, I am used for cleaning dust. Takeaway,

> Be prepared for anything when you're picked up at the store

Otherwise, I use an old iPhone 4S and an old compaq desktop, I don't own any other gadgets. I'm not really into technology.

### And what software?
Umm, I used to go out a lot but the lockdown situation during the COVID19 has changed life. It cancelled Bihu, can you imagine that? So I am just spending my days scrolling through my instagram feed and I found this [interesting page that makes Assamese illustrations](https://www.instagram.com/daakor.boson/), it's pretty neat!

Nice to see young people using their modern software to put out great content about Assamese culture, while I am still trying to torrent Bhupen Hazarika music albums from proxy piratebay sites.

### What would be your dream setup?
Its a given that my dream setup is to be tied around someone’s head [playing a dhul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk12PnNYdAw) but sometimes I think it'll be nice to just hang on to a rope in a late summer evening in a distant village.
