### Who are you, and what do you do?
Hello and Hi, I am Gamusa(গামোচা) and I am pretty cool actually if you ask. I hang out with [this man with a 56-inch chest](/interviews/0/modi.jpg), [Norvig](/interviews/0/pete.jpg), [Mehmet Dogar](/interviews/0/mehmet.jpg) and so many other interesting people that I have lost count. Heck, someone even made [COVID-19 mask](/interviews/0/mask.jpg) out of me, so you can say I am pretty darn useful.

Point is, I have been to places 🌍 but truth is, I have the most fun hanging out with the people of Assam so I've been doing that daily from the day I was born. [Zubeen's maya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgkFvPHqOWU) is added multiple times to my sleep music playlist, just thought that was interesting information.

Oh! I didn't tell you who I was? Well, technically I am a piece of rectangular cloth, red and white are my favorite color scheme for obvious  reasons. I did my graduation from Cotton University by majoring in textiles and that's where I figured out that I could significantly increase my personal brand valuation by just switching to silk threads.

I basically just hang around different places. Yeah, that's what I do if you insist.

### What hardware do you use?
What hardware do I use? Thanks for not asking what I am used for, but I'll tell you anyway. There's a dichotomy; on one hand, I am used for things of great respect and on the other hand, I am used for cleaning dust. Takeaway,

> Be prepared for anything when you're picked up at the store

Otherwise, I use an old iPhone 4S and an old compaq desktop, I don't owe any other gadget. Not really into technology.

### And what software?
Umm, I used to go out a lot but the lockdown situation during the COVID19 has changed life, cancelled Bihu! can you imagine that? So I am just spending my days scrolling my instagram feed, but I found this [interesting page that makes Assamese illustrations](https://www.instagram.com/daakor.boson/), it's pretty neat!

Nice to see young people using their modern software to put out great content about Assamese culture where I am still trying to torrent Bhupen Hazarika music albums from proxy piratebay sites.

### What would be your dream setup?
Its a given that my dream setup is being a bandanna [on someone playing a dhul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk12PnNYdAw) but sometimes I think it'll be nice to just hang on to a rope in a late summer evening in a distant village.
