## Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I am Debashis Konger and I would consider myself a photographer or you could say a photography enthusiast. üì∏

## What hardware do you use?

I use a basic [Nikon D3400](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d3400.html) with a [Nikon 50mm 1.8G lens](https://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/product/nikkor-lenses/f-mount/fx-format/single-focal-length/af-s-nikkor-50mm-f-1-8g) and Nikon 18-55 kit lens. Honestly speaking, I hear people say a lot of bad shit about the kit lens but in my opinion that's the best lens ever. üíØ

## And what software?

I use a mix between [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html) and [VSCO](https://vsco.co/). Primarily I edit my photos on my phone because it's easier and less time consuming.

## How do you go about your work?

How do I go about my work? ah! that's a difficult one. I generally have to be sitting in my room scrolling through [instagram](https://instagram.com/), listening to music or watching something. It could be an anime or a live action tv show! Ideas just hit me when I have basically nothing to do and when it does hit I just call up one of my friends and ask them if they are ready to do the shoot.

One aspect of my work is that I generally take pictures of my friends and hardly work with other models. Perks of having really good friends who aren't shy of the camera! I would actually suggest people to work with their friends as much as possible so they can develop their own style. üï∂

## What would be your dream setup?

My dream set up changes very frequently, sometimes a Canon, othertimes a Nikon and currently my heart is set for the [Sony Œ±7R IV](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm4) that is one beautiful camera! and about the lenses I would really want a [35mm 1.4](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/camera-lenses/sel35f14z) and a [16-35 mm lens.](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-16-35mm-F2-8-Wide-angle-SEL1635GM/dp/B071LHLS11) üèÉ
