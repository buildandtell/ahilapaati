Hello,

We hope this email finds you in good spirits. 

I am [[NAME_HERE]] from the AhilaPaati Team and we are interested to know more
about what you do and how you do it. :)

We are creating a series on professionals of the region and we would be honored
if you would let us feature you and your work. The feature would be textual in
nature and as such we would need to ask you a few questions.

This is purely based on your craft and your thought process, the approach,
the tools that you use that facilitate your work. If this sounds an interesting
proposition to you, please let us know, so we can continue the conversation. 

So here are the questions:
- Who are you, and what do you do?
- What hardware do you use?
- And what software?
- What would be your dream setup?

Best,
[[NAME_HERE]]
AhilaPaati Team.
