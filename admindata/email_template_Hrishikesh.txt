Hello, 

We hope this email finds you in good spirits. 

I am Hrishikesh from the AhilaPaati Team and we are interested in your work! We are creating a series on professionals of the region and we would be honored if you would let us feature you and your work. The feature would be textual in nature and as such we would need to ask you a few questions. This is purely based on your craft and your thought process, the approach, the tools that you use that facilitate your work. If this sounds an interesting proposition to you, please let us know, so we can continue the conversation. 

Best,
Hrishikesh Barman,
AhilaPaati Team.
